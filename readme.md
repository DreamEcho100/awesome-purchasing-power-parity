# Awesome Purchasing Power Parity [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> Purchasing Power Parity is a measurement of prices in different
> countries that uses the prices of specific goods to compare the
> absolute purchasing power of the countries' currencies.

A person sitting in India might have access to the same set of goods that a person in the US would have. For example, Netflix is available both in the US and in India (and hundreds of other places around the world)

But people across different geographies don't earn the same amount of money, and usually, local prices of goods reflect it very well. e.g. price of a Coke 2L (~68 oz) bottle is 4.4 USD in the US, while you can buy the thing for around 1 USD in India.

Naturally, an average person in India doesn't earn as much.

Using Purchasing Power Parity, product makers get an opportunity to price their products considering local factors. This accounts for the adjustments required in the real exchange rate between the currency of different countries.

This list features a curated set of global products with Purchasing Power Parity support.
